# Enhanced Bitcoin Price Forecasting for 2024 Halving Using Prophet

This project leverages the Prophet time series forecasting model to predict Bitcoin prices, incorporating five years of comprehensive market data. The focus is on critical market dynamics such as volatility, market cycles, investor sentiment, and particularly the 2024 Bitcoin halving eventâ€”a pivotal occurrence historically influencing Bitcoin's value. By analyzing data around previous halvings, the model aims to uncover trends crucial for forecasting future Bitcoin prices accurately.
